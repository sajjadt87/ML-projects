ðŸŒ¸ The Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning. It contains information about 150 flowers of the Iris species,
 divided into 3 different classes and contains 150 samples.

ðŸ”¹ Features (measurements of each flower):

Sepal length (in cm) â€“ the length of the outer part of the flower.

Sepal width (in cm) â€“ the width of the outer part of the flower.

Petal length (in cm) â€“ the length of the inner petals.

Petal width (in cm) â€“ the width of the inner petals.

Each flower is described by these 4 numerical features.

ðŸ”¹ Labels (target classes):

0 â†’ Iris Setosa
Small flowers, usually clearly separated from the other species.

1 â†’ Iris Versicolor
Medium-sized flowers, somewhat between Setosa and Virginica.

2 â†’ Iris Virginica
Larger flowers, often overlapping with Versicolor in measurements.

So the task is usually a classification problem: given the 4 features, predict which species the flower belongs to.
