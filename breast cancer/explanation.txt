The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is a well-known dataset included in scikit-learn, commonly used for binary classification tasks.
It contains 569 samples of breast cancer tumors, each described by 30 numerical features that are computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Features (X):
These are real-valued measurements that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as size, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
Each of these measurements has three versions: mean, standard error, and "worst" (largest value).

Target (y):
The dataset is labeled with two classes:

0: malignant (cancerous tumor)

1: benign (non-cancerous tumor)

Goal:
The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign based on these features.
