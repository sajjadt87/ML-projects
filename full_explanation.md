Hello everybody,today I am going to explain our project named ML-projects on github.
It is a repository of different ways of training ML and sometimes DL models and we will have a journey to learn data exploration too, so if you want to enjoy learning practicing and understanding how different ways of data exploration are implemented and how to train and evaluate you ML models you can join us 
link to repository:https://lnkd.in/dJhwj834
this repository consists different kind of files and folders which I am going to explain now.
each project has its own name for example the folder wind_turbines represents the wind_turbine project that is the 1rst step on our journey.
each projects file concludes 2 folders and 1 file,the file is an explanation file which explains the features,labels and the purpose of dataset.
the folder dataset has the csv file in it, and sometimes the generator.py file which is the artificial dataset generator.
the folder jupyter concludes jupyter files of the project.
some datasets are published on kaggle or sometimes new datasets are published with the goal of project so you could explore new datasets as well
