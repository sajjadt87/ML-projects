Energy Efficiency (ENB2012) — concise, technical overview

Short summary.
The Energy Efficiency dataset (often distributed as ENB2012_data.xlsx) contains simulated building designs and their corresponding Heating Load (Y1) and Cooling Load (Y2). It is commonly used for regression experiments (single-target or multi-output) and is a good testbed for tree-based regressors because the relationship between building features and loads is nonlinear with threshold/discrete effects.

Origin & how it was generated

The data were created by simulating 12 different building shapes in building-energy software (Ecotect) while varying glazing, glazing distribution, orientation and other geometric characteristics. This produced 768 simulated building cases. The dataset was published by Tsanas & Xifara (2012) and is hosted in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features (X1 → X8): eight input variables describing building geometry and glazing:

X1 — Relative Compactness (continuous)

X2 — Surface Area (continuous)

X3 — Wall Area (continuous)

X4 — Roof Area (continuous)

X5 — Overall Height (continuous)

X6 — Orientation (integer / discrete code representing cardinal orientation)

X7 — Glazing Area (continuous)

X8 — Glazing Area Distribution (integer / discrete code)

Targets (responses):

Y1 — Heating Load (continuous)

Y2 — Cooling Load (continuous)
You can model each target separately (two single-target regressors) or jointly with a multi-output regressor.

Data quality: there are no missing values reported in the UCI description (all features / targets populated).
