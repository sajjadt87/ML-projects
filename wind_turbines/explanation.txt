Hello every bidy today we are going to explore our first machine learning project which is created by an artificial dataset which has 2 goals,
to estimate the energy output of our turbine and to measure the performance level of turbines for a cleaner and easier dataset you could

we will implement many diffrent models on our dataset

the explanation of csv dataset:
blade_length: Blade length in meters, typically ranging from 10 to 100 for various turbine sizes, where longer blades capture more wind energy as seen in modern designs averaging around 52 meters.

wind_speed: Wind speed in m/s, ranging from 5 to 25, with turbines starting at 4-5 m/s, reaching max output around 15 m/s, and shutting down in high winds for safety.

turbine_stats: Turbine status category, with values 'optimal', 'needs to be repaired', or 'off', reflecting operational conditions like running efficiently, requiring maintenance, or being inactive.

energy_output: Energy output in kW with added noise, ranging from 100 to 5000, representing power generation based on wind capture and turbine efficiency in real-world scenarios.

motor_tempreture: Motor temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from 20 to 80, monitoring thermal conditions to prevent overheating during operation as part of maintenance practices.

blade_angle: Blade angle in degrees, ranging from 0 to 45, adjustable for optimizing aerodynamic performance and wind flow capture in varying conditions.

vibration_level: Vibration level, ranging from 0 to 10, used to detect potential mechanical failures or imbalances in the turbine structure for predictive maintenance.

humidity: Air humidity in percent, ranging from 20 to 90, influencing corrosion rates and overall turbine durability, especially in coastal or humid environments.

air_pressure: Air pressure in millibars, ranging from 900 to 1100, an environmental factor affecting wind density and thus energy production efficiency.

category: Turbine size category, with values 'small', 'medium', 'large', or NaN, classifying based on scale where small might be under 50m blades and large over 100m.

anti_rust: Anti-rust feature, with values 0, 1, or NaN, indicating protective coatings against corrosion from moisture and salt, crucial for longevity in harsh weather.

efficiency: Efficiency percentage, ranging from 0 to 100, measuring how effectively the turbine converts wind energy to electricity, often optimized through design and site conditions.
